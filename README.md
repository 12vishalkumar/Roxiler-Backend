# Backend task
<p align="justify">‚úç This project involves the creation of a suite of RESTful APIs designed to manage, analyze, and visualize transaction data. The goal is to build a robust backend system that can initialize a database with seed data from a third-party API, offer detailed transaction listings with search and pagination features, and provide insights through statistical analysis and chart data generation.</p>
